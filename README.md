# Pneumonia-Prediction
Hello,

# Project Title: 
Pneumonia Prediction System

# Problem Statement/Opportunity: 
Nowadays many people don't have much time to visit a doctor to show their report. So, we need a service which can predict whether a person is suffering from any disease or not. During Covid situation many patients have been admitted to the hospital who were suffering from Pneumonia. Doctors can conclude from a report whether a patient is suffering from a Pneumonia or not from Chest X Ray / CT Scan of Chest report. There were many doctors who were advising a patient to be admitted in hospital as they were suffering from Pneumonia, but the reality is doctors were also admitting the patient who were not suffering from Pneumonia. In the Health sector there is a great opportunity for introducing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which can help not only patients but doctors too for prediction of many different diseases.

# Project Description: 
To solve the above mentioned problem we have come up with an idea of prediction of Pneumonia from Chest X Ray / CT Scan of Chest report using machine learning. As we also know machines can understand better than humans, So why not develop a model which can predict whether a patient is suffering from Pneumonia or not. We will develop a model which will assure you whether you are suffering or not. This project use case will not be for only patients but for doctors, as sometimes doctors too donâ€™t understand whether a patient is suffering or not after checking the report, so doctors will also get an accurate result on conclusion of the report. If any patient doesn't have much time to verify their report with a doctor they can use our system which can help them to conclude whether they are suffering from Pneumonia or not. 

Our main aim in this project will be to predict whether a patient is suffering from Pneumonia or not.
